                <h3>ChatGPT vs. English Major: AI Writes Essays But Can't Replace Humanities Degree</h3>
                <p>
                    Enrollment in the humanities at American universities is in drastic decline. 
                    Subjects like English and history and philosophy, once popular and identified 
                    in the public mind as typifying a certain sort of college experience, have 
                    fallen into the no man’s land of subjects like Latin and Greek. 
                    They’re now redolent of a kind of fusty, unremunerative scholasticism.
                    <br><br>
                    The New Yorker called attention to this fact in a recent story. 
                    The piece by and large avoids exploring the implications of the change it describes.
                    That’s understandable. The trend isn’t new, and there’s a long tradition of 
                    jeremiads about it — written by humanities majors like myself — and the menace
                    it represents for liberal society. We’ve heard it before. “Learn to code,” 
                    as the coders say on Twitter.
                    <br><br>
                    There is one implication, though, that feels newly relevant. 
                    The various disciplines of the humanities are united by their concern with language
                    — how humans use it to communicate with each other and to persuade and dissemble
                    and misunderstand each other.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, communication is top of mind for tech types, as a thousand working groups
                    are convened to grapple with the suddenly unignorable power of generative artificial intelligence.
                    ChatGPT can write emails and business plans. It can write passable papers on Milton. It can code!
